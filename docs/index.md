Welcome to the developer documentation for the Agile Poker app!

The documentation is divided into sections, depending on what kind of information you are looking for. This is inspired by [this documentation system](https://documentation.divio.com/).

## How-To

These docs are useful if you need to know how to do a particular kind of task.

## Explanations

These docs are useful if you want to understand why the project is the way it is.

## Reference documentation

These docs are useful if you need to look something up while you're working.

**Why not use a wiki?** By making this a site within the repo itself, we get the following benefits over a wiki:

- We have more control over the organization and layout
- PRs can include updates to documentation
- Everyone has a local copy when they clone the repo
